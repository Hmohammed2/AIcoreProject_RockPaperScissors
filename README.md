## Milestone 1: Creating the Model
FIrst an image project model is created with 4 classes being: Rock, Paper, Scissors & Nothing. This was done using the web based tool "Teachable Machines". Teachable Machine is a web-based tool that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible to everyone. 
Firstly, you would have to process the images of the 4 options using either a webcam or a photo that has already been uploaded in a suitable file location. By using more image samples, this would improve the accuracy of the model.
After the tool has trained the model, it is then downloaded and exported the into a keras.h5 model to be used in the python code.

## Milestone 2: Installing the dependencies
Create an environment and then install the necessary requirements. You need, at least, opencv-python, tensorflow, and ipykernel. Pycharm was used for this.
Once the environment is setup, the model that was downloaded previously is ran on pycharm. Code is within the python file "Rock, Paper Scissors.py"
