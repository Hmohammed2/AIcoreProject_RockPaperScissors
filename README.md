## Milestone 1
FIrst an image project model is created with 4 classes being: Rock, Paper, Scissors & Nothing. This was done using the web based tool "Teachable Machines". Teachable Machine is a web-based tool that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible to everyone. 
Firstly, you would have to process the images of the 4 options using either a webcam or a photo that has already been uploaded in a suitable file location. By using more image samples, this would improve the accuracy of the model
After the tool has trained the model, it is then downloaded and exported the into a keras.h5 model to be used in the python code.
